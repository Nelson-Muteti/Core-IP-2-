## PROBLEM STATEMENT

<img src="https://www.pngitem.com/pimgs/m/153-1531127_bank-png-file-bank-png-transparent-png.png">


* Financial Inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. 

* For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 13.9% of the adult population) 

  have access to or use a commercial bank account.

* Traditionally, access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion.

*  Despite the proliferation of mobile money in Africa and the growth of innovative fintech solutions,

   banks still play a pivotal role in facilitating access to financial services. Access to bank accounts enables households 

   to save and facilitate payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness and improve their access to other financial services.

* Therefore, access to bank accounts is an essential contributor to long-term economic growth.

* For this reason, I did this project to be able to figure out how we can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. 

* This project looks at  two sets of data collected over three years and make recommndations based on the model chosen.

* This project details  how I approached this problem and came up with insights and 
 
 a basis for  recommendations I later made. 

* The project goes from Data Loading, Data Cleaning and understanding while exclusion and inclusion procedures are 

  outlined. I used the CRISP DM Methodology to approach the project.

* The CRISP DM methodology helps break down the problem statement  into bits which are then 

  relatively easier to approach.

## Data Used

* The data used over the course of this project was collected from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda

 over a period of three years and can be found on the main branch

 from our project documentation.

* There are two datasets;one is the Bank Access dataset while the other is a glossary( variable definitions dataset)

## Technologies Used

* I Used Google Colab (IPYNB)  as my primary work environment..
 
* I found Colab  to be a great tools to implement the Data Science project since it was 
   
  easier to  link with resources and platforms such as GITHUB.

## Support

* Contact me for further clarifications at:

* More data is also welcome inorder to improve my recommendation system.
